# What We Do

What started as a small experiment selling the Parsi dishes I learnt as a new Parsi bride has today snowballed into a full-time Parsi food delivery service that aims to make delicious home-cooked bhonu available to people across Mumbai easily.

While we are really flexible and eager to get our hands dirty with new opportunities, below is just some of the kinds of occasions where our Parsi food has been the star of the show

* Birthdays
* House Parties
* Anniversaries
* Packed Lunches
* Conferences
* Group Parsi Pop-ups
* Business Meets
* Office Celebrations
