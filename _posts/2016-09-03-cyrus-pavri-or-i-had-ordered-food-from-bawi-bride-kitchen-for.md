  Cyrus Pavri | I had ordered food from Bawi Bride Kitchen for a house party.
  The food was excellent specially the mutton pulao and chicken farchas were
  simply awesome. Perzen was very helpful in getting the order quantity just
  right for the party. If you're on the look out for authentic Parsi food, Bawi
  Bride Kitchen is where you should order from.
